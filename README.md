## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system** using Deep Learning.

It serves as a **core module of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**, enabling vehicles to interpret road signs such as speed limits, warnings, and navigation indicators.

---

## 🚗 ADAS Integration

This system supports ADAS functionalities such as:

- 🛑 **Speed Limit Detection** – Assists in maintaining safe speeds  
- ⚠️ **Warning Sign Recognition** – Detects hazards and alerts drivers  
- 🔄 **Navigation Assistance** – Identifies directional signs  
- 🔔 **Driver Alerts** – Displays real-time predictions  
- 🤖 **Decision Support** – Provides input for autonomous systems  

> ⚠️ Note: This project currently performs **classification only**. Full ADAS requires detection, tracking, and sensor fusion.
